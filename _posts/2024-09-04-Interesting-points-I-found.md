"Even language modeling can be viewed as classification: each
word can be thought of as a class, and so predicting the next word is classifying the
context-so-far into a class for each next word." - Speech and Language Processing. Daniel Jurafsky & James H. Martin. Copyright © 2024. All

". Generative classifiers like naive
Bayes build a model of how a class could generate some input data. Given an observation, they return the class most likely to have generated the observation. Discriminative classifiers like logistic regression instead learn what features from the
input are most useful to discriminate between the different possible classes." - Speech and Language Processing. Daniel Jurafsky & James H. Martin. Copyright © 2024. All
